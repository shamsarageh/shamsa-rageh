# what I'm doing here.

I'm writing this post on the steps of a fire escape in a not-seedy part of town. Making my own website from scratch has been easier than I'd like to admit - it's a task I have devotedly been putting off for several months. But I'm here now. Not wanting to place my thoughts, these most precious of things, on a platform like Substack or Medium has me hammering down all of this text in a markdown file. White knuckles, my hands cold as they've ever been, with a few hours of daylight left before the day becomes a thing to contemplate, and not live inside. I want my words to live on in this little patch of internet. Static and uncrackling. I'll be back to center a heading tomorrow, or later this evening, probably. See ya later.
