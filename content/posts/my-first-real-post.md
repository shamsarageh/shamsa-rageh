# what I'm doing here.

I'm writing this post on the steps of a fire escape in a not-seedy part of town. Making my own website from scratch has been easier than I'd like to admit - it's a task I've been devotedly been putting off for several months. But I'm here now. Not wanting to place my thoughts, these most precious of things, on a platform like Substack or Medium has me writing this all down in a markdown file. White knuckles, my hands cold as they've ever been, with a few hours of daylight left before the day becomes a thing to contemplate, and not live inside. I want my words to live on in this little patch of internet. Static and uncrackling. I'll be back to center a heading tomorrow, or later this evening, probably. See ya later. 

## A Subheading

I can include:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text* 
- [Links to other sites](https://example.com)

> This is a quote

And regular paragraphs of text.
