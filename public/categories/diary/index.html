<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post on the steps of a fire escape in a not-seedy part of town. Making my own website from scratch has been easier than I&rsquo;d like to admit - it&rsquo;s a task I&rsquo;ve been devotedly been putting off for several months. But I&rsquo;m here now. Not wanting to place my thoughts, these most precious of things, on a platform like Substack or Medium has me writing this all down in a markdown file. White knuckles, my hands cold as they&rsquo;ve ever been, with a few hours of daylight left before the day becomes a thing to contemplate, and not live inside. I want my words to live on in this little patch of internet. Static and uncrackling. I&rsquo;ll be back to center a heading tomorrow, or later this evening, probably. See ya later.</p></div>
