      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-im-doing-here&#34;&gt;what I&amp;rsquo;m doing here.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post on the steps of a fire escape in a not-seedy part of town. Making my own website from scratch has been easier than I&amp;rsquo;d like to admit - it&amp;rsquo;s a task I have devotedly been putting off for several months. But I&amp;rsquo;m here now. Not wanting to place my thoughts, these most precious of things, on a platform like Substack or Medium has me hammering down all of this text in a markdown file. White knuckles, my hands cold as they&amp;rsquo;ve ever been, with a few hours of daylight left before the day becomes a thing to contemplate, and not live inside. I want my words to live on in this little patch of internet. Static and uncrackling. I&amp;rsquo;ll be back to center a heading tomorrow, or later this evening, probably. See ya later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
